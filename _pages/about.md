About Me
======
I'm a PhD student in the marine robotics group, ACFR, USYD, supervised by Prof. [Stefan B. Williams](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/stefan-williams.html) and Prof. [Oscar Pizarro](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/oscar.pizarro). I am always happy to try new algorithms in real-world applications. 

Research Interests
======
Try to train a good model with few human annotations by active learning, semi-supervised learning, and pre-trained models. Also, I'm happy to try to use these algorithms in various real-world applications, such as image annotation for marine environment analysis, AUV informative path planning, etc.

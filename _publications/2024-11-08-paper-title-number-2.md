collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2024-11-08-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'This paper is about balancing overall cost (labeling cost and training cost) and active learning sampling time. Some intriguing empirical analysis on which part of sample selection difference between the proxy model (used in efficient AL) and the fine-tuned model (used in standard AL) contribute to AL performance drops and why.'
